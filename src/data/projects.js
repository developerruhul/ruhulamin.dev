      description: `It's a well-designed chrome extension with a drag-&-drop interface to build a complete bot/web scraper without knowing a single line of code. The features are too many to list here. I developed the extension from start to almost finish. Of the 1.5 years of work there "my favorite part was coming up with a solution to add support of shadow DOM, iframe, and lazy-loading which none of the competitors have yet. I've developed a deep understanding of the Javascript DOM while working on this project."`,

      description: `It‚Äôs the dashboard or control panel of the automatio app that runs in the cloud. It displays the output data of the web scraper bot(that was created using the chrome-extension) running the cloud. It has payments, notifications, etc. The feature list is just too long to list here. Besides transforming the beautiful design into code I also worked on a whole lot of other things including building the whole notification system, optimizing the frontend and backend to show the output data(which can sometimes be over 30-40MB), building a real-time ‚Äúoutput data‚Äù update system that shows scraped data as soon as it‚Äôs finished in the cloud. I have learned so much about design, architecture, performance etc while working on it.`,
